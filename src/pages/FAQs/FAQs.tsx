            We'll be getting hitched at the beautiful <a href="https://thelodgeonecholake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lodge on Echo Lake</a> just outside of Lake George, NY.
            The ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, and after party will all be held on the grounds of the Lodge.

          <p>
            The wedding and reception will be cocktail formal attire. The ceremony will be outside, so plan for a still fall breeze to blow through. Once we're all done,
            with dinner, there will be a large bonfire with smores, drinks, and games, so bring the most comfortable thing you own! (There will be time and space available to change).

            We'll have more information about lodging closer to the event. Since it is so close to Lake George, and we're technically in the "off season", there should be plenty of options available.
            We will post some recommendations closer to the date.

            Expect an amazing weekend, with all of the people you love the most in the same place (that's what we're expecting!).

            Lake George is a truely amazing little town, nested in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains that is absolutely worth the visit. We'll be there in some capacity from Thursday through Sunday,
            so feel free to come early or stay late! We'll be posting some recommendations for things to do in the area closer to the date.
